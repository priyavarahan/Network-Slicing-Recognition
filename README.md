# Network-Slicing-Recognition
This project focuses on enhancing network slice allocation using advanced Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and ensemble learning techniques. The goal is to devise a predictive model that accurately determines the most suitable network slice for varying requirements, thus improving network performance and resource efficiency. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse network conditions and service needs, the project employs AutoML to streamline the model development, ensuring effective model selection tailored to specific data characteristics. Ensemble learning methods are used to enhance accuracy and mitigate individual model biases.

Key metrics used to evaluate the models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, aiming to deliver a scalable solution for network slice allocation in 5G networks. This initiative is set to establish new standards in network optimization, advancing towards more responsive, efficient, and user-focused 5G networks.
